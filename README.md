# HealthcareAnalysis_inR
In this project, I perform an exploratory analysis to find out if the health of Company A's employees are getting sicker or if the increase in health scores can be attributed to hiring more people.

# Question Asked: 
The questions I am answering are as follows:

<b>Question 1A:</b> Are all the values in the data reasonable? Are there missing values?

<b>Question 1B:</b> What are the characteristics of employees at Company A? Do these demographics change over time? Use tables and charts to understand the data and demographic characteristics of employees at Company A. 

<b>Question 2:</b> Which characteristics are associated with the health score? Use tables and charts to determine which characteristics are associated with the health score. 

<b>Question 3:</b> Using the information from Questions 1 & 2, describe how you would evaluate the claim that employees are getting sicker. First list how you would evaluate the claim. Then, time-permitting, implement the steps you suggested. 

# Goal 
My goal for this project was to: understand the data, explore relationships between variables, and evaluate the claim that Company A's employees are getting sicker. 

# I learned:
This was an exercise that reminded me that not all is what it seems because the prompt allowed me to use linear regression but it "was not required", so I knew this project was not going to be straight forward. After some researched, I remembered that if we are working with time, (12 quarters), and taking repeated health measurements from employees, that the quarters are dependent on one another and therefore, my stepping off point was taking a look at the sample sizes of each quarter, which drastically increased each quarter.
